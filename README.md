# Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Project

Data analytics project covering the entire data analysis pipeline, from data collection to machine learning implementation. The project is divided into key modules, each focusing on essential data analytics concepts and tools.

üöÄ Project Objectives:
- Performed data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights.
- Apply machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Design interactive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.

üéØ Modules Covered:
- Data Analytics Using Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, and basic statistical analysis.
- Data Analytics Using SQL: Data querying, aggregation, joins, and subqueries for structured data analysis.
- Introduction Using Python: Basic Python programming, data structures, and functions.
- Python for Data Science: Data manipulation using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for visualization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in datasets.
- EDA Using Tableau: Visual storytelling and data dashboards for interactive insights.
- Interactive Dashboards with Tableau: Advanced dashboard creation for real-time analytics.
- Statistics Using Python: Descriptive and inferential statistics, hypothesis testing.
- Machine Learning: Implementing supervised and unsupervised learning models for predictive analysis.
- Capstone Project: Integrating all concepts to solve real-world business problems.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies:
- Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, and statistical functions.
- SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
